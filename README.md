# CitiBike-Tableu-Assignment

# STEP 1: I selected Feb-Sep 2021 to work with as it was a the most recent data for this year and January had mismatching features in the dataset. 
# STEP 2: The data was cleaned and then joined to make two Feb-Sep 2021 datasets - one for NYC and one for Jersey City

# STEP 3: I then set about exploring the data using Tableau to identify interesting trends

# STEP 4: I quickly became interested in the movement of bikes and also the use case for why customers were using the service

# STEP 5: I noticed a phenomenon where the bike type suddenly changed from majority "dockable" to majority "classic" and thought worthy of exploration - the data would suggest that there was a significant change in the types of bike available throughout the scheme, and this was to follow the trend of more casual users as compared to a previously high member rate

# STEP 5: I was interested in exploring the relationship between rider use case and days of the week. As expecred, Sunday saw a decrease in what I deemed to be "leisure" use case where trips started and ended at the same bike station. However, I did not expect to see a maintained rate of what I categorised as "desitation" trips on Saturdays, which is where riders where using the service to commute to a different destination - I thought this was an interesting phenomenon, especially as the Saturday count of destination trips was as high as any weekday.

# STEP 5: Finally the data was all visualised on the map and included a bubble size difference relating to total bike station usage, and a colour differentiation relating to the number of return trips - i.e, "leisure" use cases. This visual is very informative and especially useful for highlighting trends in movement as expained in my Tableau story.

# ISSUES ENCOUNTERED:

# I could not save a local copy of the Tableau workbook, nor could I make all dashboards and visuals available on the original submission. Nobody had explained that I need to use a "hack" to obtain the local copy of the workbook by uploading the project to Tableau Public and then downloading a local copy. As a new user to Tableau I thought it was unreasonable to expect us to know that this was an option. Also, my previous grader stated that they could not see all dashboards, I have since discovered that there is an option within the Tableau Public page to show all available panes - this has been switched on.

# Lot's of inconsistencies in the data that I could not fathom, even with the help of the BCS Learning Support Staff - the count of Station ID's, Station Names, and Lat/Longs do not match, even in the original data files from the CitiBank server.

# My map is showing dual bubbles for the same location in some instances - I am at a loss as to what is causing this as all Station Name, Station Id's , Start Lat, and Start Long appear to be the same. I cannot afford to allocate any further time to this project - I am a PowerBI user after all!
